"""
schema.py contains all of the input and output schemas for our server

The schemas are all defined with marshmallow, which you can read about here
=> https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/

ðŸš¨ Changing the keys on the schemas will change the inputs and outputs for our server.
ðŸš¨ So before you change the keys, please check that all of our clients are updated!

The schemas are tested by writing tests for the controllers. We could instead choose to
test the schemas directly, if they controller tests (and their database calls) become
too heavy.

TODO - pipe all of these into autogenerated OpenAPI v3 definitions.
